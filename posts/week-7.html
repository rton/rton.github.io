    This week I found a way to allow modifications to be made to talks that follows the
	requirements, and I took a look at the Recording Tool code to figure out where changes 
	will need to be made for the refactor. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Here's a quick explanation of the changes that've been made to the Talk Editor:
    </p>
    <p>
    I found that the reason talks were being unselected was because the QDataWidgetMapper was
    submitting the form everytime a field lost focus. This is a default setting for 
    QDataWidgetMapper objects, so I changed the submit policy to 'Manual'. The requirement,
    as suggested by the mentors, was to make changes effective some time (3 to 5 seconds)
    after the last change was made to any field. To do this, I connected textChanged(), 
    timeChanged() and dateChanged() signals to a function that would start a timer. When the 
    timer reached 0, the timer would emit a timeout() signal and call the database update_presentation
    functionfunction. 
    </p>
    <p>
    One additional thing to note is that the textChanged(), timeChanged() and dateChanged() signals
    need to be blocked whenever a talk is added, selected, or updated. The reason for this is that
    these events modify the input fields by either filling them with existing metadata or whitespace,
    which naturally emit these signals. And the end of these events, the signals are unblocked.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the feature to record straight to a file, one of the mentors suggested I look at the
    command line option that allows for that. I found it was calling a function in the RecordController
    class, which will be extremely useful for the necessary changes. One of the mentors also 
    suggested that the Recording Tool should record straight to file if no talk is selected, 
    then prompt the user for a file name when the recording is complete. For now, 
    I think most of the changes I make will be to the load_backend() and record() functions 
    of the RecordingApp class.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the coming week, I'll be finishing up the Talk Editor UI changes (namely a prompt to
    notify the user if there are talks with empty titles in the database), and starting changes
    for the Recording Tool backend.
