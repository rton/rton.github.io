    This week most of my work was towards the Talk Editor UI. I implemented the change allowing
    changes to talks to take effect after 3 seconds of the last change, but the result was not
    what the mentors were looking for. After some discussion, it was decided that the Save Talk
    button was to be used for saving changes to existing talks, and clicking the Add Talk
    button would open a popup containing an instance of TalkDetailsWidget for the user to fill
    out and submit. Submission would create a new talk in the db, which would appear in the table,
    while cancelling would discard the new talk.
    </p>

    I opened a PR related to allowing the Save Button to be used for existing talks, and I
    attempted to create the popup for adding new talks. From what I've seen so far, the Talk Editor
    cannot handle signals emitted by the popup, which is unfortunate because it would have meant
    minimal changes and minimal code in what is currently the NewTalkWidget class. I'll
    investigate further to see if there's a simple solution.

    I also spoke to one of the mentors for clarification on separating the recording logic from
    the Presentation class. I hadn't realized this initially, but the intent was to remove all
    (or as many) instances of Presentation from the Multimedia class, which handles the recordings.
    I found that these instances were being used only to generate filenames and to prepare metadata,
    so it seems like these steps can be performed by the RecordingController instead.
    </p>

    In the coming week, I hope to finish the New Talk popup, and completely separating Presentation
    from Multimedia. I also want to start on my changes for the Recording Tool UI.
