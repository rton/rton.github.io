    <p>
    This week was a slow week because of final projects and tests. I made some
    changes based on feedback for my PRs for #444 and #523. I hope to get them
    merged by the end of the week. I also opened up a new issue (#542). 
    </p>
    <p>
    For the remaining time I hope to wrap up all my remaining PRs. I'd like to
    stay on the Freeseer team to try and fix a few other issues I opened up 
    during this term.
