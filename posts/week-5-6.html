    This post is a combination of week 5 and week 6 since I missed a post during
    the code sprint.
    </p>
    <p>
    In these two weeks I made some necessary tweaks to the Talk Editor UI after
    discussing the requirements with the mentors. The most noticeable difference
    is that the 'Add New Talk' button is now at the top of the interface next to
    the 'Export' and 'Remove' buttons. In addition, selecting the 'Add New Talk'
    button will create a new talk in the table. Unfortunately, this change in
    functionality led to some complications, which I discovered during the
    code sprint.
    </p>
    <p>
    To elaborate, the way editing a presentation currently works is that a talk is
    selected in the table, and then a field must be selected while the talk in the
    table is still selected. Once the field is modified, the only way to save the
    change is to either press 'Return' on the keyboard, or to unassign the focus
    from the modified field (which can be done by pressing 'Tab' or simply
    clicking elsewhere on the screen). The problem with this is that when either
    of these actions are performed, the desired talk in the table is unselected,
    which means the user must reselect the talk every time they want to modify
    another field.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have looked into a few ways to modify this behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
    My first attempt was to connect each field to an 'editingFinished' signal, which
    is supposed to recognize a change in focus or when 'Return' is pressed. I
    set it up so that each time the signal was called the application would reselect
    the row. This worked well until I tested it using 'Return'. Pressing 'Return'
    would discard my change and refill the field with the previous value, which
    was strange considering the signal description said it would handle the case.
    </p>
    <p>
    My second attempt was to look into modifying the actual behaviour of the QTableView,
    which was recommended to me by one of the mentors. I found an attribute called
    tabKeyNavigation, which enables the use of 'Tab' to traverse the table. However,
    even after disabling it, the original behaviour persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also started taking a look at the Recording Tool so I can begin refactoring
    it as required for issue #444, and I completed my Project Proposal, although
    much of it is likely subject to change.
    </p>
    <p>
    This coming week I'll be thinking of ways to address the Talk Editor UI problem,
    and figuring out the changes I need to make to the Recording Tool.
