    This week I made some final changes to my current PRs for issues #523 and #444 based on
    feedback from the mentors. This included ensuring that the descriptions were clear enough
    for anyone to understand the effects of the patches, since they may be picked up by another
    individual in the next term.

    It was definitely a great experience, and I enjoyed working on Freeseer. There are quite a
    few unresolved issues opened by me, so I'd like to stay on the Freeseer team and work on them
    when I have the time.
