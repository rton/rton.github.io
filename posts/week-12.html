    This week I made some changes based on feedback for the Add New Talk popup window. I also 
    opened a new issue for adding a menubar option to record to file. I think the best approach 
    for this new feature would be to prompt for a filename after the recording is complete, so
    I'll probably set that up in the coming week. Unfortunately, my builds seem to be failing 
    because flake8 is being particularly sensitive and is addressing style issues in files I 
    have not modified. Hopefully this issue is addressed soon.

    I also spent some time preparing a poster for March 28th. I'll be presenting my contributions and
    learning experience from UCOSP.
