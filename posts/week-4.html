    This week I obtained some of the missing dependencies with the help of
    another student, and discussed with the mentors a bug in Freeseer that was
    preventing the ability to record.  After taking a look at my logs, the
    mentors found that the application was attempting to create a name for the
    new recording using metadata from an empty talk. Because of this, the file
    name being returned was an empty string.  I opened an issue once the cause
    was found, the bug was fixed by a mentor and the issue was closed shortly
    after.
    </p>

    Also, under the recommendation of the one of the mentors, I worked on
    issue GH #427: warning the user of unsaved data in the Freeseer talk
    editor. I committed my changes and made a pull request for the commit.
    There's a lot to get used to; in particular, the workflow for committing
    changes, and the style for commit messages (e.g. starting the summary with
    "Fix #[issue number] [issue description]"). Python hasn't been too
    difficult to pick up, but I know I've barely scratched the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
    This coming week I'll be talking to the mentors about some additional
    changes to the talk editor, and hopefully figure out exactly what I want
    to do for a project this term.
