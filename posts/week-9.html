    This week I split up one of my PRs (#495) into several smaller ones (#502, #509), with a few
    more to come. Once that's complete, I'll get rid of the unrelated changes in #495. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition, I made the final changes to my PR for issue #427, and they were finally merged 
    to the main branch. I also opened a new issue (#501) as requested by one of the mentors, 
    which is related to issue #427. If I have time, I'd like to work on it, especially since it
    addresses a similar issue I found in our new approach to editing talks.

    I fixed up my change for the Recording Tool when a presentation is selected - I wasn't
    assigning a value for the filename parameter. I also created a new menubar option to record
    straight to file, which worked; however, this action isn't reflected in the actual GUI.
    I'd like to find a way to have the GUI react the same way as if the 'Prepare to Record' 
    button was being selected, then have a window appear when the recording is stopped asking
    the user for a filename. That will be part of next week's task.
