    This week I implemented the new features for the Talk Editor that were decided on last week (saving
    changes to existing talks using the Save Talk button, and displaying a popup for adding talks,
    #521 and #523 respectively). I may try to organize the code for the popup a little better in
    the coming week, but it works as it should, and the Talk Editor refreshes the table when a
    new talk has been added.

    I also moved the logic for preparing metadata and creating a filename from the Multimedia
    class to the RecordingController class. This removed all instances of Presentation from
    Multimedia, as required by #444. I also disabled the Record button when no presentations are
    selected, which indicates an empty talk database. However, the build failed so I will need to
    amend that in the coming week. I will also need to work on the changes for the Recording Tool
    UI. This mainly involves having a dialog appear requesting a filename for a recording that is
    not associated with any presentation. It will appear when the 'Record to File' menubar option
    is selected, and, ideally, will have a confirmation and cancellation button ('Record' and
    'Cancel', perhaps).
