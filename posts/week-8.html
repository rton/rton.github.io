    This week I made some more changes to the Talk Editor UI. I added a prompt that appears when
    the user attempts to close the editor while there are untitled talks in the database. They
    are given the option to continue closing, in which case they'll lose the untitled talks, or
    cancel closing. This caused a bit of trouble during unit testing since the test attempts to
    close the editor while an untitled talk is present, and does not provide a response when
    the prompt appears. 
    </p>
    <p>
    On that note, I tried to close the prompt in the unit test by triggering a key click event
    for 'Y', which would answer 'Yes' to the prompt to continue closing. However, no lines 
    following the editor actionExit() trigger were being called. I think this may be due to the
    prompt locking the main event loop. To work around this, I added a single shot timer that
    would start before the actionExit() trigger, and would last 10 ms. After the timer had
    finished, it would call a function to trigger the key click event I intended on using 
    originally. This worked, and everything passed successfully. I'll definitely need to write
    more unit tests in the future for all the other changes I've made to the UI.

    In addition, I started refactoring the Recording Tool logic to accept a filename.
    I made it so that if no talk is selected, it uses a default filename instead. I plan to 
    give the user the option to edit this filename once they've completed their recording.
    </p>

    The last thing I did was move a whole bunch of commits from the #427 issue to a new issue
    I opened that seems more related to the changes I've made. The mentors helped me with this,
    particularly by suggesting cherry-picking and how to format my commits from now on into a 
    single one using rebase and amend.
