                    This week I obtained some of the missing dependencies with the help of another student, and discussed with the mentors a bug in Freeseer that was preventing the ability to record. After taking a look at my logs, the mentors found that the application was attempting to create a name for the new recording using metadata from an empty talk. Because of this, the file name being returned was an empty string. I opened an issue once the cause was found, the bug was fixed by a mentor and the issue was closed shortly after. <br /><br />
                    Also, under the recommendation of the one of the mentors, I worked on issue GH #427: warning the user of unsaved data in the Freeseer talk editor. I committed my changes and made a pull request for the commit. There's a lot to get used to; in particular, the workflow for committing changes, and the style for commit messages (e.g. starting the summary with "Fix #[issue number] [issue description]"). Python hasn't been too difficult to pick up, but I know I've barely scratched the surface. <br />
                    This coming week I'll be talking to the mentors about some additional changes to the talk editor, and hopefully figure out exactly what I want to do for a project this term. <br/ >
